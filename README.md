# Art Storefront Customizer

**A WooCommerce plugin designed for fine artists**. This plugin customizes product listings to reflect the language, presentation, and sales flow used by high-end art platforms like Saatchi Art—replacing “Add to Cart” with “Collect Now”, showing “Collected” badges, enabling artist profiles, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

Most WooCommerce stores speak the language of retail. Artists selling original work or edition prints need a storefront that speaks to collectors, galleries, and museums. This plugin helps independent artists—especially those with limited time or money—elevate their online presence using their own WordPress site.
